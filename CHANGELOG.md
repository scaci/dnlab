# Changelog

All notable public changes to dNLab are recorded in this file.

This changelog is generated from the structured release sources in
`docs/releases/`. Internal bug-tracking references stay in the private
operational repository and are not published here.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-07-08

Logging release that standardizes runtime infrastructure logs under a single
/var/log/dnlab root across the Docker stack.

### Changed

- Runtime log layout: Persistent service logs now live under /var/log/dnlab with
  dedicated subdirectories for proxy, gui, auth-db, multinode, image-sync,
  lab-cleanup, and image-build.
- Image-build job logs remain application data: Image-build job logs stay under
  /var/lib/dnlab-image-build/logs because they are job history data used by the
  GUI, not service infrastructure logs.

### Breaking

- Unified runtime log root: /etc/dnlab/paths.yml now uses log_root:
  /var/log/dnlab. The previous public keys log_dir_gui and log_dir_multinode are
  removed, and the Compose environment variables DNLAB_LOG_DIR_GUI and
  DNLAB_LOG_DIR_MULTINODE are replaced by DNLAB_LOG_ROOT.

### Upgrade Notes

- Create the log root before recreating services: sudo mkdir -p /var/log/dnlab
- Replace old logging keys in /etc/dnlab/paths.yml with log_root: /var/log/dnlab
- Replace DNLAB_LOG_DIR_GUI and DNLAB_LOG_DIR_MULTINODE with DNLAB_LOG_ROOT in
  .env customizations.
- Recreate runtime services with docker compose -f compose.yml up -d
  --force-recreate proxy gui auth-db multinode image-sync lab-cleanup
  image-build.
- Run ./smoke.sh after the upgrade to verify service health and log files.

### Artifacts

- Source archives: *-0.1.2-source.tar.gz (GitHub Release)
- Source checksums: SHA256SUMS (GitHub Release)
- Proxmox LXC template: dnlab-lxc-proxmox-0.1.2-amd64.tar.zst (GHCR and GitHub
  Release mirror)
- Proxmox LXC release notes: LXC-RELEASE-NOTES-0.1.2.md (GHCR and GitHub Release
  mirror)

## 0.1.1 - 2026-07-07

Bugfix release for stale per-lab service cleanup and Docker Compose naming, plus
runtime helper image prefix consistency.

### Fixed

- Orphan per-lab service containers were not always cleaned up: The cleanup
  reconciler now protects a lab only when actual VD runtime containers are
  running. Per-lab service containers such as runtime relay, DNS, jumphost,
  legacy logging services, and mgmt-anchor no longer keep an inactive lab from
  being cleaned up by themselves.
- Duplicated Docker Compose service prefixes: Compose service keys were
  normalized so the Compose project name no longer produces duplicated
  dnlab-dnlab-* container names. Documentation now uses the clean service names
  such as proxy, gui, multinode, image-sync, lab-cleanup, image-build, and
  auth-db.
- Runtime helper image prefix mismatch: Runtime helper image naming is now
  driven by configuration instead of duplicated Compose defaults, keeping local
  flat image names and GHCR release image names consistent across multinode
  services and release image preload placeholders.

### Artifacts

- Source archives: *-0.1.1-source.tar.gz (GitHub Release)
- Source checksums: SHA256SUMS (GitHub Release)

## 0.1.0 - 2026-06-18

Initial public dNLab release with the Docker Compose distribution, GHCR image
publication, corresponding source archives, and the first Proxmox LXC template
artifact.

### Added

- Public Compose distribution: Added the public dNLab distribution repository
  with Compose files, install documentation, source availability policy, and
  administrator guides for the first published release.
- GHCR release images: Published the dNLab service image family under
  ghcr.io/scaci/dnlab-* for versioned installations.
- Proxmox LXC template: Published the first ready-made Proxmox LXC template for
  dNLab with the required Proxmox helper assets and first-boot setup flow.

### Artifacts

- Source archives: *-0.1.0-source.tar.gz (GitHub Release)
- Source checksums: SHA256SUMS (GitHub Release)
- Proxmox LXC template: dnlab-lxc-proxmox-0.1.0-amd64.tar.zst (GHCR and GitHub
  Release mirror)
- Proxmox LXC release notes: LXC-RELEASE-NOTES-0.1.0.md (GHCR and GitHub Release
  mirror)
